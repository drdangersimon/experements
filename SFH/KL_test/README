I want to figure out which wavelengths are used to recover different paramters using the kullbackâ€“leibler divergence.

I will fit a full spectrum and compare the postieror revoerd of each marganalized parameter to a uniform distribution.
Wavelengths that give the biggest change will be used to determine which areas matter.

I can check this by comparing it to a Leverage score of the SSP libraies for age and metalicity.
