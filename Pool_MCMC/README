Testing for pool MCMC. Sometimes likelihood calculation takes too long to run sequentually. But I have the power of manny processors, but I want only 1 chain to run. How do I speed this up?

Pool MCMC, has 1 chain, with a head worker and sub-workers who calculate the likelihood.

sub-workers psuedo code:
1. get current state of main chain
2. calculate likelihood
3. return to main chain
4. check if to quit
5. if not, go to 1

Main worker code:
1. normal mcmcm
2. instead of calculating likelihood, look in pool, choose randomly weighting with time in pool
3. update stats and sent to sub-workers
4. goto 1 if exit critera not met.
